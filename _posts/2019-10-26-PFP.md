title: Patellofemoral Pain and Me
---


# What is Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome? 
The patellofemoral joint is made up of the fossa where the patella slides between the two femoral condyles. The word patella means a small dish in greek. The word condyle means knuckle, and is the rounded things on the end of bones. PFP is also known as runners' knee or Chondromalacia patellae. The word chondromalacia is derived from the Greek words chrondros, meaning cartilage and malakia, meaning softening. 

So, PFP is when the articular cartilage on the backside of your knee softens because it has rubbed too much on the surface of one of your femoral condyles. It is aggrivated by most activity which involves knee bending conditioned on how much force your quad is exerting at the time, which will grind your patella into the condyle as you're moving. Patellofemoral articular cartilage cannot directly be a source of nociception , as it is avascular and aneural. However, a cartilage lesion may lead to chemical or mechanical synovial irritation, edema, or erosion- all of which can result in pain.

So, the goal is to let the articular cartilege harden back up, which will then let the synovium around the area calm down.
