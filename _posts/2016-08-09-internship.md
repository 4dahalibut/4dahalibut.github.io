title: Things I learned from my Internship
---

## About Myself
 * I work much harder when I feel like there's work I should be doing, that I know how to start on, and that improves something I care about
 * Starting things is hard
 * I can work all day effectively, if the work isn't super brain-intensive.
 * I like making cleanliness and ease of understanding a perogative
 * I'm good but fairly slow at programming.
 * I'm slow when I don't stay cognizant on what I'm trying to accomplish, and the steps I'm taking to get there.
 * I'm slow to make up my mind
 * I need to work on creating a decisive, cleaned-up front to approach business with
 * My memory is pretty crap, I think I remember most things for like 2 weeks. so I should write things down when I learn them.

## About software

 * Code should be structured towards functional clarity first, but testability also.
 * Testability comes with modularization, you should be able to run a part of your code separately from the rest
 * Both unit tests and full-form tests are important, and should be developed incrementally
 * Git is important for every project
 * Good-looking code means uniform code
 * Each unit and group of code should have a clear purpose, and this purpose should be reassessed as coding goes on
 * Infrastructure can be more difficult than programming
 * It is important to work on difficult problems, not just on whatever

## About people

 * People are fickle and don't care about you by default
 * Provide value to people, and make sure they understand you provide value
