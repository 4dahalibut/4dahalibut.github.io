I"ø<p>This election cycle, I tried to get a job at one of the companies that receive the donations you give to your preferred candidate, that try to convince those Other People to vote like you do. I failed to secure one of these jobs. I made it decently far in a few interview loops but ended up with bupkis. For this essay, I am concentrating on the interview loop that was the shortest; you could also refer to it as a ‚Äúsingle interview‚Äù.</p>
