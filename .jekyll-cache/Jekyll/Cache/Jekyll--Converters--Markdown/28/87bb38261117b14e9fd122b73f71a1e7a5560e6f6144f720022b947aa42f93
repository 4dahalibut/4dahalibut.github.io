This Saturday I spent some time looking through the <a href="https://methane.jpl.nasa.gov">Methane Source Finder</a> put out by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-duren-a4950a16/">Riley Duren</a> of JPL. The paper can be found paywalled <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1720-3">here</a>. The authors allow that landfills are by far the largest contributor to the issue, but interestingly don’t “name and shame” the locations and operators, which makes sense because they are working with the operators to clear up the issues <a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22467">which is great</a>. However, I of course will name and shame them. Here are the top 5.</p>
