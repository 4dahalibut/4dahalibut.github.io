I"~<p>So <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/366/6464/447.full.pdf">this article</a> has been making the rounds recently . The idea is that there are algorithms used to recommend patients for more intensive care which predict using the “label” of the future cost of the patient.  While using a label related to cost is easy because the data can be collected simply, and it is a simple numeric value, it embeds the history of black ppl getting less healthcare done, and the paper claims that this means that blacks have significantly higher amount of sickness conditioned on this risk score than white ppl. The question of whether “amount of sickness” is tied to their underlying metric of number of chronic conditions seems open to me, but opening up the conversation of the use of money as a proxy for other labels seems like a useful addition to the public dialogue.</p>
