I"’<p>When you think of your vote in the great 2020 election, ask yourself why you voted for who you did. After four years of being barraged by the media, you probably reason you voted for Trump which I know all of you did because of one big thing, such as ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù and then maybe if you spent long enough thinking about it, a few other things, such as how much you hate ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù or how not-with-it Biden seems. Whatever your reason for voting for Trump, I put forward that if you were left to research cold hard facts from unbiased sources, you would find quite a different set of issues as the most prominent, and probably happen to ignore at least one minor reason that contributed to your vote.</p>
