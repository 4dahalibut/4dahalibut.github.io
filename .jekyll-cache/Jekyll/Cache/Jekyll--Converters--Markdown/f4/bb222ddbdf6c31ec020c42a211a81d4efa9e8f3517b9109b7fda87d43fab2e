I"¡<p>I canvassed in Maine today, two days before the election. Global Warming meant that the trees still carried their fall radiance. I drove up on my own, because I couldnâ€™t manage to convince any of my Boston friends to join me. After I picked up my terf and parked my car by an abandoned physical therapy practice, I was so anxious to start canvassing I had to take a hit from my dugout to get out of the car.</p>
